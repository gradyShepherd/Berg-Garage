					<h4>Our Story</h4>
					<p>Our shop is a long-time family owned and operated business, small town business. Having started our business
					 in Martinsdale, Montana, we moved to White Sulphur Springs in the 1970's with the hope of growing our business. 
					 Since doing this, we have been able to expand our services to a much broader range. We are a proud vendor of Cooper
					  Tires, supplier of fine, Conoco quality gasolines, and one of the main propane suppliers in our area. In addition,
					  we also make bulk fuel deliveries to the ranches around the area. Our main function is still servicing our customers cars, 
					  and making them safer. Our mechanic works on all parts and components on all makes and models of vehicles. We deal with the 
					  local parts store as much as we can, keeping our business local. We were a proud dealer of GM products until recently. In 
					  our many years dealing with GM, our business won several awards for our loyalty and effectiveness. 
					  Our number one priority is and always has been our customers' satisfaction.</p>
